This script searches file geodatabases and replaces the SRS field with EPSG:4326, the standard used by the US Geothermal Project.

It requires the easygui module, but advanced users can replace this with a direct entry in the script of the path to the file geodatabases directory.

An Arc tool exists for this as well.  Upon request I can develop and test it further.
